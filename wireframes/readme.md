We have created a number of mocked-up views.

[A click-through-able version is available here](http://adobe.ly/1VKE2OX)

##query.png

This is a standard query view with aggregate figures displayed at the top of the screen a download data button and a list of projects included in the query.

##single-project.png

Clicking either a row in the projects table or a pin on the query map takes you to a single project view. Here you can see aggregate figures for that project followed by a list of participants.

An individual project can also be viewed on a map.
