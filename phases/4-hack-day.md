#Phase 4 – Organise workshop/hack day to understand how data will be consumed

##Phase overview

Earlier phases of this project developed a platform for serving data about the performance of arts projects. The goal of such a platform, in the long term, is to have a reporting and analysis web app built (such as the one mocked up [here](../wireframes/all-views.png)) that consumes this data to allow both artists and funders to understand what projects they should be doing/funding. The build of such an app is a project in its own right and beyond the scope of this project, however, it would be good to both:

* Understand what people would like to get out of the data
* Prototype the basics of the web app

This will give the project a strong basis on which to apply for further funding.

As a result, the project should host a hack day with arts organisations, open data experts and developers to develop a prototype app using the API developed in earlier stages of this project.
