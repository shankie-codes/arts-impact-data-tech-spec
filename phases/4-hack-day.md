#Phase 4 – Organise workshop/hack day to understand how data will be consumed

##Phase overview

Earlier phases of this project developed a platform for serving data about the performance of arts projects. The goal of such a platform, in the long term, is to have a reporting and analysis web app built that consumes this data to allow both artists and funders to understand what projects they should be doing/funding. The build of such an app is a project in its own right and beyond the scope of this project, however, it would be good to both:

* Understand what people would like to get out of the data
* Prototype the basics of the web app

This will give the project a strong basis on which to apply for further funding.


##Technical implementation – estimated person-days

Activity | Estimated days
--- | ---
Hack day prep | 2
Hack dat | 2
Post-mortem | 2
**Total** | **6 days**

##Technical implmentation – estimated elapsed time

2 months

##On-going effort

While there's less administrative overhead than Phase 2, some small amount of review/approval and querying will be needed for self-submitted data. We suggest 0.5 days per arts project added.

##Advantages

* Reduced reliance on a central administrator
* Greater engagement of arts organisations – they can manage their own data

##Disadvantages

* Increased cost
* Reporting and analysis still relies on technical know-how
